description: This lecture provides a brief overview of the political history of Iraq
  including geographical and economic components. It traces politics from Babylonia,
  Assyria, through the Caliphates and Ottoman Empire to the colonial mandate and finally
  the more recent wars (Iran-Iraq War, Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and U.S.-British
  invasion of Iraq). It explores the history of factionalism and relationships between
  sectarian groups and the spatial demographic distribution. Finally, it looks at
  the most recent political history including the political parties from the 2004
  election. Currently a disjuncture exists between reconstruction planning and cohesive
  national planning that incorporates economic, social and environmental goals. In
  the 1950s the World Bank planned Iraq's economy to be based on agricultural production,
  but what Iraq needs is a vision that first meets basic needs and then surpasses
  this initial provision.
